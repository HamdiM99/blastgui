Run these commands in the terminal in order to execute the app : 
          1. sh setup.sh 
          2. sh run.sh

Once we are done using the app, we want to free up the listening ports. To get all the processes running streamlit and free them up for use we can run our cleanup script: 
sh cleanup.sh
